# Moved development at https://github.com/DubbleClick/gMod

Requirements:
- The DirectX SDK (I use June 2010)
- Visual Studio (2010+)
(- Maybe CMake if you don't want to use Visual Studio)

Usage:
Create a file in the root GuildWars folder (where gw.exe is located) called modlist.txt
Each line in the modlist.txt is the full path to a mod you want to load (eg. D:Games\uMod\Mods\Borderless Cartography Made Easy 2015 1.3.tpf)
uMod will load all these files on startup
